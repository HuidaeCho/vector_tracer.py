## Examples

`grasslogo.svg` is also available from
https://grass.osgeo.org/images/logos/grasslogo.svg. `horse.csv` and `lion.csv`
were created using coordinates from
https://andymac-2.github.io/fourier-polygon/. `pi.csv` was directly copied from
https://dsp.stackexchange.com/a/59181/41245.

```bash
vector_tracer.py -c grasslogo.svg green fourier-grasslogo-with-circles.gif
vector_tracer.py grasslogo.svg green fourier-grasslogo.gif
vector_tracer.py horse.csv brown fourier-horse.gif
vector_tracer.py lion.csv darkgoldenrod fourier-lion.gif
vector_tracer.py pi.csv black fourier-pi.gif
